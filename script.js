    description: "The To-Do List app is a project that was created to provide it's users with a tool to list some tasks that they would like to accomplish within a day. The key features of this app include: an input, a list area, clear all button and reset button. The input allows the user to type a description for a task. The list shows all added tasks with the individual checkboxes, edit areas and trash icons. A user can mark a task as complete, edit the task and delete an individual task. The clear all completed button allows the user to remove all tasks that have been marked as complete. The reset button allows the user to reset the entire list to an empty list. I used html, css and JavaScript to implement this project. In the course of implementing the exercise, I faced a few challenges such as making the rest button to rotate on click. I found a solution on the w3 articles on animations. I would like to add a section that lists all previously completed tasks in future",
